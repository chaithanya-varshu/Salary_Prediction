# Salary Prediction - Based on Census Data
 Predict whether income exceeds 50k per year based on census data
<h3>Description</h3>
We are using Census dataset here with almost 50000 instances and 14 features. It contains categorical and numeric type of values for differnt features. It also has missing values. To see full description of dataset please use <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult"> Dataset Link </a> .
We are going to do all our analysis in python like observing the data, cleaning the data, transforming the data and finally training the data.
<br>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
Hope you already have some python basics and you have ready any python environment like Jupyter.
You need to install all the below libraries in your python environment. You can do this in Python IDLE using simple pip command.
<h5>numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib</h5>
<br>
<h3> 1. Loading the Data</h3>
First we need to store the data file in your local machine somewhere and from that path we load the CSV file into Jupyter Notebook.
For reading the file, we use PANDAS library. We can also mention the delimiter type and header detais if need.
<br>

    import pandas as pd
    adult = pd.read_csv('adult.csv')

<h3> 2. Observing the Data</h3>
Now we look what are the columns in the data and what kind of values are present in the data. And we can see howmany number of rows of data is available for our analysis.
<br>

    adult.columns()
    adult.values()
    adult.shape
    adult.head()
    adult.tail()

<br>
We will see results like below.

<h3> 3. Cleaning the Data</h3>
<h5> 3.1 Remove Unwanted Rows </h5>
From the above analysis, we see fields 'education' and 'education_num' are two fields which are interrelated and we can use only field for analysis. Because this might lead to multi-colleniarity problem. And field 'finalwgt' is another informative field, we can remove this too.
<br>
So this is our next step, we are gonna drop those columns. This can be done in many ways, we can explicitly mention all the fields we gonna keep or drop those 2 fields.

    mydata = adult.iloc[:,[0,1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]]
    mydata
    #adult.drop(['fnlwgt', 'education'])

<h5> 3.2 Look for null values </h5>
Now we have to check for any null values in the dataset. Null values are 'na' values which can be any of the default null values present in PANDAS library like Nan, #NA,.. etc.

     mydata.isnull().any()
     mydata.isnull().sum()
     mydata[pd.isnull(mydata['Age'])] # to check only in Age column.

We find some values like 'No Gender' in Age column, so we replace these values with default 'na' values.

     mydata["Age"].fillna("No Gender", inplace = True)

<h5> 3.3 Removing '?' Rows </h5>
There are also some values with '?' in the dataset. These can also be replaced with 'na' values like above. Or while reading the file itself we can mention null values with an attribute. So here first we find out what are the columns have '?' values.

     for each_column in mydata.columns:
         if ' ?' in mydata[each_column].values:
             print (each_column)

This gives 3 columns as 'workclass', 'occupation' and 'native-country'.
<br>
We also want to see howmany such '?' rows are existing in each column. This is the step by step processing of missing values. This is the most important step in any Pre-processing.

     mydata.loc[mydata['workclass']==' ?'].shape  #1836
     mydata.loc[mydata['occupation']==' ?'].shape  #1843
     mydata.loc[mydata['native-country']==' ?'].shape  #583

Now what do we do with these rows, these are not numerical values to replace with mean or median. These are important categorical values. If we see the data size, from total around 50K rows if we remove like 1800 rows , that would be a best approach as we won't mislead data with inappropriate data. So let's remove them.

     final_data=mydata[mydata.workclass!=' ?']
     final_data=final_data[final_data.occupation!=' ?']

<h5> 3.4 Transform data from charcter to numeric </h5>
Now we have to do some transformations to the character variables to numeric values. We do this to apply an ML algorithm. For an algorithm its all numbers, for eg, if we have values as 'private' and 'public' it converts them to 0 and 1 or may be 1 and 2. This way we can apply a classification prediction on the dataset.
<br>
In Python we have 'LabelEncoder' library to do that for us. So we transform each column one by one.

     final_data['workclass']=LabelEncoder().fit_transform(final_data['workclass'])
     final_data['marital_status']=LabelEncoder().fit_transform(final_data['marital_status'])
     final_data['occupation']=LabelEncoder().fit_transform(final_data['occupation'])
     final_data['relationship']=LabelEncoder().fit_transform(final_data['relationship'])
     final_data['race']=LabelEncoder().fit_transform(final_data['race'])
     final_data['sex']=LabelEncoder().fit_transform(final_data['sex'])
     final_data['native-country']=LabelEncoder().fit_transform(final_data['native-country'])
     
<h3> 4. Splitting Train and Test data</h3>
Now we have to seperate the output column and input columns. We can also say Independent columns(input) and Dependent column(output). Here our output variable is the last column income. Using numpy functions we will split them into X and y.

     x= final_data.iloc[:,:-1]
     y=final_data.iloc[:,-1]
     
The next step is splitting. We use 80 to 90 % of the data for training the model and we test it on the remaining 10% of the data which is called test data. This split can be randomly applied by the Python function 'train_test_split'

     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
     x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.20)

<h3> 5. Binary Logistic Regression Model</h3>
We first try fitting the train data with 'Binary Logistic Regression'. Here the output 'income' variable is have only 2 categories, either >50K or <=50K. So this is binary classification. If it is more than 2 types we cannot use 'Binary Logistic Regression', we use multi regression models.

      from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
      logreg=LogisticRegression()
      logreg.fit(x_train,y_train)
      y_pred = logreg.predict(x_test)

y_pred is the predicted outcome on the test data we kept aside. We have to compare this y_pred with y_test values and check how much data is a match. This is how we estimate the accuracy of the model. We have certain measure like 'accuracy_score' , 'confusion_matrix' and 'classification_report' to evaluate the model. We can use 'metrics' library in python to find these values.

     from sklearn import metrics
     cnf_matrix = metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test,y_pred)
     print(cnf_matrix)
     print("Accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred))
     
     Out: [[4311  274]
           [ 867  692]]
          Accuracy: 0.8142903645833334

We got good accuracy here. This can also be seen graphically, using 'auc roc curve'. Based on this curve we can see how good the accuracy of the model is. To plot the graphs we use 'matplotlib' library.

     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     y_pred_proba = logreg.predict_proba(x_test)[::,1]
     fpr,tpr,_=metrics.roc_curve(y_test,y_pred_proba)
     auc=metrics.roc_auc_score(y_test,y_pred_proba)
     plt.plot(fpr,tpr,label="test data ,auc="+str(auc))
     plt.legend(loc=1)
     plt.show
 
 We will see the ouput as below.

<h3> 6. NaiveBayes Model</h3>
For the same trained dataset, now we try to apply the NaiveBayes model to see the accuracy. NaiveBayes classifier is a good classifier, it looks for probabilistic nature of data to predict the future data. We directly look for accuracy.

     from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB, MultinomialNB
     #create a Gaussian classifier
     gnb = GaussianNB()
     
     gnb.fit(x_train, y_train)
     y_pred = gnb.predict(x_test)
     print('Accuracy thru Gaussian Naive Bayes ', metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
     
     Out: ccuracy thru Gaussian Naive Bayes  0.7859700520833334

Now the roc_curve:

     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     y_pred_proba = gnb.predict_proba(x_test)[::,1]
     fpr,tpr,_=metrics.roc_curve(y_test,y_pred_proba)
     auc=metrics.roc_auc_score(y_test,y_pred_proba)
     plt.plot(fpr,tpr,label="test data ,auc="+str(auc))
     plt.legend(loc=1)
     plt.show

We will get the curve as below.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Congratulations, you made it this far. We have read, clean and processed the data. We trained data wih different models and compared the accuracies. From the above we see 'Binary Logistic Regression' model is giving good accuracy score 81.4%. This can be increased using Bagging or Boosting techniques, by means training multiple times by shiffling ,different sets of data.
<br>
Thank you...
